# UI/UX Design

## Library Structure  
- The library has three sections: **Currently Reading**, **Read**, and **Want to Read**.  
- When users open the **Books** tab, they can easily switch between these sections.  
- Inside **Currently Reading**, books are grouped by genre (for example, Fiction, Classic, Romance, or Fantasy).  
- This setup helps users:  
  - See what they’re reading right now.  
  - Look back at completed books with notes and ratings.  
  - Plan what to read next.

## Navigation Flow  
- BookBuddy uses a **simple navigation bar** at the top or side.  
- Main pages include:  
  - **Home:** Shows monthly goals and reading progress.  
  - **Library:** Displays all books organized by reading status.  
  - **Monthly Tracker:** Shows progress for the current month.  
  - **Completed Books:** Lists finished books with ratings and notes.  
  - **Profile / Settings:** Lets users manage their account and preferences.  
- The layout stays consistent on every page so the app feels simple and easy to use.

## Interaction Design  
- Book cards have quick-action buttons like **Add**, **Edit**, **Delete**, and **Mark as Read**.  
- A **search bar** connected to the Open Library API lets users find books quickly.  
- The app gives feedback through:  
  - Progress bars  
  - Star ratings  
  - Check marks for completed books  
- Accessibility is supported with:  
  - Large, easy-to-tap buttons  
  - Clear labels on icons and text  
  - Keyboard navigation for all users

## Key Interactions  
- **Sign Up:** Users enter their name, email, and password to make an account.  
- **Login:** Users sign in to see their saved books and progress.  
- **Home:** Shows reading stats and shortcuts to the Library and Monthly Tracker.  
- **Books:** Users can view all books, open details, change status, edit, or delete entries.  
- **Book Details:** Shows the title, author, genre, rating, and notes.  
- **Monthly Tracker:** Displays this month’s reading goals and progress.

## Example User Flow  
- The user opens **BookBuddy** and logs in.  
- On the **Home** page, they see their reading progress.  
- They tap **Books** to check *Currently Reading*, *Read*, or *Want to Read*.  
- In *Currently Reading*, books are grouped by genre.  
- The user searches for a new book and adds it to *Want to Read*.  
- When finished, they mark it as *Read* and watch their progress update.  

---

## Application in BookBuddy  
- The design starts with **wireframes** for the *Sign Up*, *Login*, *Home*, *Books*, and *Monthly Tracker* screens.  
- After layouts are finalized, each screen becomes a **mockup** with real colors, icons, and fonts.  
- This process helps the team:  
  - Test how the app works early.  
  - Keep a consistent, clean design.  
  - Show realistic screens during sprint reviews.
