## 1. What We Accomplished (Final Sprint)
Sprint 3 delivered all remaining core features needed for a complete, demo-ready version
of BookBuddy:

- Completed full Monthly Tracker (backend + frontend).
- Rewrote MonthlyTracker and MonthlyTrackerBook models.
- Implemented monthly aggregation logic and UI.
- Completed manual book entry end-to-end.
- Connected manual entries into UserBook.
- Fixed login flow and added homepage navigation.
- Completed Review system after solving relationship issues.
- Identified and resolved a logic error that allowed adding duplicate books to the user's library.
- Performed final integration, testing, and stabilization.

All planned features were successfully delivered in the final sprint.

---

## 2. What Went Well
- The Monthly Tracker subsystem was fully redesigned and integrated effectively.
- Manual book entry significantly improved app flexibility.
- The Review feature, despite initial modeling issues, was completed successfully.
- Duplicate-book logic fix increased system stability and prevented inconsistent user data.
- Frontend–backend collaboration was smooth after mid-sprint.
- Communication and debugging were efficient and consistent.
- Velocity improved compared to prior sprints.

---

## 3. What Could Be Improved
- The Review feature required unexpected restructuring of relationships.
- A logic flaw allowed users to add the same book multiple times to their library. 
  We discovered this issue during integration, updated the backend logic, and added 
  safeguards to prevent duplicates.
- Backend redesign consumed additional early-sprint time.
- UI polishing began later due to backend dependencies.
- Some tasks were larger than initially estimated.

---

## 4. What We Learned (Final Project Reflection)
- Early detection of logic edge cases (such as duplicate book entries) prevents larger
  data consistency issues later.
- Clearer early data modeling prevents later refactoring.
- Daily communication significantly reduces blockers.
- Breaking stories into smaller tasks increases accuracy of estimates.
- Prioritizing demo-critical features is crucial in the final sprint.
- Solving unexpected issues (like Review mapping and duplicate-book logic) is a normal 
  part of real-world software development.

## 5. Final Conclusion
Sprint 3 concludes the project with a fully functional, stable, and integrated version of
BookBuddy. All major features—including Monthly Tracker, Manual Book Entry, Review
system, and corrected Book Library logic—were delivered successfully after overcoming
technical obstacles.

The team is confident in the final demo and the quality of the final system.
