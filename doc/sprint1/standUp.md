[OCT 19th] - Sprint 1 Standup 1

1. What did you work on since the last standup?
We worked on the product backlog, identifying the main features, defining user stories, and prioritizing them.
We also started planning the main classes and database entities for the backend.

2. What do you commit to next?
We will design the relationships between entities (like User–BookCatalog–MonthlyTrackerBook)
and finalize the UML class diagram for implementation.

3. When do you think you will be done?
4. We expect to finish the initial design and documentation by the end of this week.

4. Do you have any blockers?
Not major ones, but we’re still confirming how the entity relationships will
map in the database (one-to-one vs one-to-many).


[OCT 26th] - Sprint 1 – Stand-Up 2

1. What did you work on since the last stand-up?
We finalized the class and database design and reviewed the layered architecture (Model, Repository, Service, Controller).
We also confirmed the code structure and started coding the main service and repository classes.

2. What do you commit to next?
To complete the controller endpoints and integrate all layers so that the API is functional and ready for testing.

3. When do you think you’ll be done?
By the middle of next week, we expect the backend structure and main CRUD features to be working.

4. Do you have any blockers?
Some minor uncertainties about connecting layers efficiently and organizing imports,
but no major technical blockers.

[Nov 2nd] - Sprint 1 – Stand-Up 3

1. What did you work on since the last stand-up?
We tested the backend using Swagger, which took around three hours of debugging and corrections to fix all the endpoint issues and ensure everything functioned properly.
During this process, we identified logic errors across the service and controller layers, corrected them, and verified that all API routes worked as expected.

2. What do you commit to next?
To finalize the documentation, update the UML diagrams, and prepare the final project demo for Sprint 1.

3. When do you think you’ll be done?
We plan to complete all testing and documentation by the end of the sprint.

4. Do you have any blockers?
No major blockers — the main challenge was the long debugging session, but everything is now working correctly.
