# Definition of Done

A user story is considered **done** when all of the following criteria are met:

## Standard Criteria

1. **Code Complete**

   - All code is written and committed to a feature branch
   - Code follows team conventions (naming, structure, comments)
   - No placeholder or commented-out code remains

2. **Tested**

   - Code compiles/runs without errors
   - Manual testing performed for the feature
   - Edge cases considered and handled

3. **Reviewed**

   - Pull request created and reviewed by at least one team member
   - All review comments addressed
   - Approved before merging to main

4. **Integrated**

   - Merged into main branch without conflicts
   - Frontend and backend integration verified (if applicable)
   - Application runs successfully after merge

5. **Documented**
   - README updated if setup steps changed
   - Code includes clear comments for complex logic
   - API endpoints documented in backend README (if new endpoints added)

## Additional Criteria

6. **User Acceptance**

   - Feature works as described in the user story
   - Acceptance criteria from the user story are met
   - Feature is accessible from the UI (if frontend feature)

7. **Clean State**
   - No console errors or warnings introduced
   - Database migrations applied (if schema changes)
   - No broken links or dead code paths

**Note**: These criteria apply to all user stories in our product backlog. If a story doesn't meet these requirements, it goes back to "In Progress" status.
