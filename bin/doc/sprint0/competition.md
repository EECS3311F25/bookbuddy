## Existing Competitor

### GoodReads

Goodreads is a social cataloging platform that lets readers organize books into shelves, rate and review them, follow authors, and share reading updates.

### 1. How is your product different?

Each user has **one main library** for their current reads. When a book is started, it’s added to this library and placed in a **genre section** like _Fiction, Classic, Romance, Fantasy,_ or _Young Adult._  
A built-in **monthly tracker** lets users create a reading list for each month, helping them stay organized and motivated to finish their selected books.

### 2. If your product is better for specific users and/or specific scenarios

This app is ideal for **casual readers and students** who want a clean, organized way to manage their reading without extra clutter.  
The **monthly tracker** helps them stay consistent with short-term goals, while the **main library with genre sections** makes it easy to see what they’re currently reading at a glance.  
It’s perfect for anyone who wants a simple, motivating reading experience focused on **progress rather than social features.**

### 3. Who are the users and/or what are the scenarios?

- A **student** creates an October list with two novels to finish for their literature course.
- A **casual reader** adds a new romance novel to their main library and marks it under the _Romance_ section.
- A **busy professional** organizes their current reads by genre to decide what to focus on next during free time.

### 4. Why do you think the competitors didn’t focus on these users and/or scenarios? And, what would it take from them to do so?

Goodreads focuses on **social reviews** rather than personal tracking.  
Adding features like **monthly goals** and **progress tracking** would require a major redesign to support more **individual, goal-based reading experiences.**
